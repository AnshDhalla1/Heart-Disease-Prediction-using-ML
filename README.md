# Heart-Disease-Prediction.
In this project we will evaluate several popular machine learning algorithms such as Logistic Regression, SVC, Decision Tree, KNN, Xgboost, GaussianNB, and Random Forest to determine which model performs the best in predicting heart disease. The accuracy of each model will be compared, and the results will be presented in an accuracy comparison graph. The main objective of this project is to develop an accurate and reliable machine learning model for heart disease prediction that can assist medical professionals in making timely and accurate diagnoses.
